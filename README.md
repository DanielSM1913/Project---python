#This project analyzes the impact of cyberattacks across different industries by examining attack frequency, resolution methods, incident response times, and financial losses. We sought to answer several key questions using the dataset provided. First, we investigated which industry is most targeted by cyberattacks and found that industries face a similar number of attacks overall; however, the IT industry is targeted the most with 478 incidents, likely due to its central role in managing digital infrastructure, while the government and telecom sectors experience the fewest attacks at 403, possibly due to stricter security measures. We also examined the incident resolution time for the attacks and concluded that resolution durations are generally similar across attack types, with malware attacks taking the longest at an average of 37 hours, while the overall mean resolution time across all attacks is approximately 36 hours. In exploring how attacks were resolved, we observed that antivirus software is the most commonly used mitigation technique because it effectively addresses the most prevalent threat, malware, whereas AI-based detection is used the least, likely due to its early adoption stage and limited implementation. Finally, when evaluating the financial effects of each attack type, we found that DDoS attacks produce the highest average financial loss at $52 million due to their ability to disrupt critical services, while malware attacks result in the lowest average loss at $49 million because they can often be contained more quickly. Instructions for running our notebook are simple: after cloning the repository, install the project requirements using the provided "requirements.txt" file and open the Jupyter notebook to run the analysis.
